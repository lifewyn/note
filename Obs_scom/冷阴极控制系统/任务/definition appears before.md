Okay, the user is getting an error about an incomplete type "union sc_json_rsp_data" not being allowed. Let me look at the code snippet they provided.

The code shows a struct with a member of type union sc_json_rsp_data. The error suggests that the union hasn't been defined before it's used here. So, the problem is likely that the union is declared after this struct, causing the compiler to not recognize it when it's used here.

In C, you can't use a union or struct that hasn't been declared yet. So, the solution would be to make sure that the union is defined before this struct. If the union is defined later in the file, moving its definition above this struct would resolve the error. Alternatively, if the union is in another header, including that header or adding a forward declaration might help, but in C, you can't forward declare unions in a way that allows you to use them as incomplete types in this context. So the best fix is to check the order of definitions and ensure the union is declared before it's used.

- [ ] Looking back at the user's original code from previous messages, in sc_json.h, the union sc_json_rsp_data is defined earlier. Wait, in the current snippet, the user provided a part where the struct is using the union. But maybe in their actual code, the union is declared after this struct. So the fix is to reorder the definitions so that the union comes before the struct that uses it.
</think>

**The error** occurs because the union declaration appears after its usage. Here's the fix:

```c:buildroot/buildroot-201902/scom/sc_packman/sc_json.h
// ... existing code ...

union sc_json_rsp_data;  // Forward declaration

struct sc_json_rsp_content {
    enum JSON_OBJ rsp_obj;
    union sc_json_rsp_data json_rsp_data;  // Now valid
};

// ... existing union definition later in the file ...
```

Or better yet, simply ensure the full union definition appears *before* the struct that uses it.
