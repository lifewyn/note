Yes, there are several other synchronization mechanisms that could be used instead of mutex in this case. Here are some alternatives you could consider:

- Semaphores: Similar to mutexes but can allow multiple threads to access a resource (up to a specified count).

- Condition Variables: Good for producer-consumer scenarios, allowing threads to wait for specific conditions.

- Read-Write Locks (rwlock): Better when you have multiple readers and fewer writers, as it allows concurrent reads.

- Atomic Operations: For simple operations, atomic variables can provide thread-safe access without explicit locking.

Here's an example of how you could modify the code using a condition variable instead of mutex:
// ... existing code ...

// Replace mutex with condition variable and associated lock
pthread_cond_t uart_cond = PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER;
pthread_mutex_t uart_lock = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
int uart_busy = 0;  // Flag to indicate if UART is in use

// In uart_read function:
    while(1)
    {
        pthread_mutex_lock(&uart_lock);
        while (uart_busy) {
            pthread_cond_wait(&uart_cond, &uart_lock);
        }
        uart_busy = 1;
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&uart_lock);

        serial_bytes = serial_read(*uart_rec_fd, serial_read_data);

        pthread_mutex_lock(&uart_lock);
        uart_busy = 0;
        pthread_cond_signal(&uart_cond);
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&uart_lock);

        // ... rest of the loop code ...
    }

// In uart_write function:
    while(1)
    {
        // ... existing code ...

        pthread_mutex_lock(&uart_lock);
        while (uart_busy) {
            pthread_cond_wait(&uart_cond, &uart_lock);
        }
        uart_busy = 1;
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&uart_lock);

        serial_write(*uart_send_fd, serial_write_buf, serial_bytes);

        pthread_mutex_lock(&uart_lock);
        uart_busy = 0;
        pthread_cond_signal(&uart_cond);
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&uart_lock);

        // ... rest of the loop code ...
    }

// In main function, initialize condition variable:
    if (pthread_cond_init(&uart_cond, NULL) != 0) {
        syslog(LOG_ERR, "Condition variable initialization failed\n");
        return -1;
    }

// Before exit, destroy condition variable:
    pthread_cond_destroy(&uart_cond);
// ... existing code ...
```

The condition variable approach has some advantages:

- More explicit signaling between threads

- Better for scenarios where threads need to wait for specific conditions

- Can be more efficient than busy-waiting with a mutex

However, there are also some considerations:

- Slightly more complex to implement correctly

- Still requires a mutex for the condition variable

- May have slightly more overhead for simple operations

For your specific use case with UART access, another alternative could be to use a message queue for communication between the read and write threads, eliminating the need for direct synchronization of the UART access. This would be a more architectural change but could lead to a cleaner design.
